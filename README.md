# My GitHub account was made using my Wake Tech email address and is registered as a student. 
# The repository I created was a clone of the original repository and I am working on it right now. 
# The first step I took was to make a account in GitHub, clicked the "+" button to create a repository, then clicked on the option to clone the repository, choose the file location for the repository, and finally accessed it through File Explorer.
